Poultry Ownership and Genetic Antibiotic Resistance Determinants in the Gut of Preschool Children;HUMAN MEDICINE HUMANS;Zoonotic transmission is likely a pathway for antibiotic resistance. Data from a randomized trial of pediatric antibiotic administration were secondarily evaluated to determine if poultry ownership was significantly associated with the presence of gut genetic antibiotic resistance determinants among 118 children in Burkina Faso. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants were classified using DNA sequencing. We measured the relationship between genetic resistance determinants and chicken ownership using a logistic regression model adjusted for confounding variables. Children in households reporting poultry ownership had four times the odds of tetracycline resistance determinants in the gut compared with those without household poultry (odds ratio [OR]: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.08-15.44, P = 0.04). There was no statistically significant difference found for other antibiotic classes. Understanding the origins of antibiotic resistance may help spur the development of interventions to combat the global AMR crisis.;1;Medi
World Health Organization Ranking of Antimicrobials According to Their Importance in Human Medicine: A Critical Step for Developing Risk Management Strategies for the Use of Antimicrobials in Food Production Animals;RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUSBLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONSESCHERICHIA-COLIANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCEBACTERIAL-INFECTIONSBETA-LACTAMASESUSCEPTIBILITYCAMPYLOBACTERPIGSQUINOLONE;"The use of antimicrobials in food animals creates an important source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that can spread to humans through the food supply. Improved management of the use of antimicrobials in food animals, particularly reducing the usage of those that are ""critically important"" for human medicine, is an important step toward preserving the benefits of antimicrobials for people. The World Health Organization has developed and applied criteria to rank antimicrobials according to their relative importance in human medicine. Clinicians, regulatory agencies, policy makers, and other stakeholders can use this ranking when developing risk management strategies for the use of antimicrobials in food production animals. The ranking allows stakeholders to focus risk management efforts on drugs used in food animals that are the most important to human medicine and, thus, need to be addressed most urgently, such as fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and third-and fourth-generation cephalosporins.";0;Medi
Poultry Ownership Associated with Increased Risk of Child Diarrhea: Cross-Sectional Evidence from Uganda;POISSON REGRESSION APPROACHFECAL CONTAMINATIONDRINKING-WATERYOUNG-CHILDRENINFECTIONSEXPOSUREINFANTSHYGIENEHOUSEHOLDSLIVESTOCK;Domestic animals have been associated with enteric infections in young children and can also be carriers of respiratory viruses. We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of health outcomes in children aged < 5 years associated with animal presence among 793 rural households in Uganda. We recorded the 2-week prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory infections in children, and the number of cows, poultry, sheep/goats, and pigs in the household. We used generalized linear models with robust standard errors to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) for diarrhea and respiratory infections associated with households owning the above- versus below-median number of animals. We conducted unadjusted and adjusted analyses controlling for socioeconomic, water, sanitation, and hygiene indicators. Children in households with the above-median number (> 5) of poultry had 83% higher diarrhea prevalence than those with <= 5 poultry (adjusted PR = 1.83 [1.04, 3.23], P = 0.04). Children in households with the above-median number (> 2) of cows had 48% lower prevalence of respiratory infection than those with <= 2 cows (adjusted PR = 0.52 [0.35, 0.76], P < 0.005). There were no other significant associations between domestic animals and child health. Studies should assess if barring chickens from indoor living quarters and sanitary disposal of chicken and other animal feces can reduce childhood zoonotic infections;0;Medi
Clinical and economic impact of antibiotic resistance in developing countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis;INTENSIVE-CARE-UNITBLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONSACINETOBACTER-BAUMANNII BACTEREMIAPSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA BACTEREMIASTAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS BACTEREMIAVENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIARISK-FACTORSMULTIDRUG-RESISTANTESCHERICHIA-COLIKLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE;"Introduction Despite evidence of the high prevalence of antibiotic resistant infections in developing countries, studies on the clinical and economic impact of antibiotic resistance (ABR) to  form interventions to contain its emergence and spread are limited. The aim of this study was to analyze the published literature on the clinical and economic implications of ABR in developing countries. Methods

A systematic search was carried out in Medline via PubMed and Web of Sciences and included studies published from January 01, 2000 to December 09, 2016. All papers were considered and a quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). Results

Of 27 033 papers identified, 40 studies met the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and were finally included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Mortality was associated with resistant bacteria, and statistical significance was evident with an odds ratio (OR) 2.828 (95% CI, 2.231 -3.584 p = 0.000). ESKAPE pathogens was associated with the highest risk of mortality and with high statistical significance (OR 3.217 95% CIs 2.395- 4.321 p = 0.001). Eight studies showed that ABR, and especially antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE bacteria significantly increased health care costs.

Conclusion

ABR is associated with a high mortality risk and increased economic costs with ESKAPE pathogens implicated as the main cause of increased mortality. Patients with non-communicable disease co-morbidities were identified as high-risk populations.";0;Medi
Antimicrobial drug-resistant Escherichia coli from humans and poultry products, Minnesota and Wisconsin, 2002-2004;PHYLOGENETIC GROUPRETAIL FOODSCLONAL GROUPCOMMUNITYENTEROBACTERIACEAEINFECTIONSEMERGENCEPLASMIDSANIMALS;The food supply, including poultry products, may transmit antimicrobial drug-resistant Escherichia coli to humans. To assess this hypothesis, 931 geographically and temporally matched E. coli isolates from human volunteers (hospital inpatients and healthy vegetarians) and commercial poultry products (conventionally raised or raised without antimicrobial drugs) were tested by PCR for phylogenetic group (A, B1, B2, D) and 60 virulence genes associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E coli. Isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (n = 331) were compared with drug-susceptible isolates (n = 600) stratified by source. Phylogenetic and virulence markers of drug-susceptible human isolates differed considerably from those of human and poultry isolates. In contrast, drug-resistant human isolates were similar to poultry isolates, and drug-susceptible and drug-resistant poultry isolates were largely indistinguishable. Many drug-resistant human fecal E coli isolates may originate from poultry, whereas drug-resistant poultry-source E. coli isolates likely originate from susceptible poultry-source precursors.;0;Medi
How Safe is Chicken Litter for Land Application as an Organic Fertilizer?: A Review;antibiotic residueschicken litter contaminantsgrowth hormonesheavy metalshumananimal and environmental healthpathogenic microorganisms;Chicken litter application on land as an organic fertilizer is the cheapest and most environmentally safe method of disposing of the volume generated from the rapidly expanding poultry industry worldwide. However, little is known about the safety of chicken litter for land application and general release into the environment. Bridging this knowledge gap is crucial for maximizing the benefits of chicken litter as an organic fertilizer and mitigating negative impacts on human and environmental health. The key safety concerns of chicken litter are its contamination with pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, helminthes, parasitic protozoa, and viruses antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes growth hormones such as egg and meat boosters heavy metals and pesticides. Despite the paucity of literature about chicken litter safety for land application, the existing information was scattered and disjointed in various sources, thus making them not easily accessible and difficult to interpret. We consolidated scattered pieces of information about known contaminants found in chicken litter that are of potential risk to human, animal, and environmental health and how they are spread. This review tested the hypothesis that in its current form, chicken litter does not meet the minimum standards for application as organic fertilizer. The review entails a meta-analysis of technical reports, conference proceedings, peer-reviewed journal articles, and internet texts. Our findings indicate that direct land application of chicken litter could be harming animal, human, and environmental health. For example, counts of pathogenic strains of Eschericiacoli (10(5)-10(10) CFU g(-1)) and Coliform bacteria (10(6)-10(8) CFU g(-1)) exceeded the maximum permissible limits (MPLs) for land application. In Australia, 100% of broiler litter tested was contaminated with Actinobacillus and re-used broiler litter was more contaminated with Salmonella than non-re-used broiler litter. Similarly, in the US, all (100%) broiler litter was contaminated with Eschericiacoli containing genes resistant to over seven antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, and sulfonamide. Chicken litter is also contaminated with a vast array of antibiotics and heavy metals. There are no standards set specifically for chicken litter for most of its known contaminants. Even where standards exist for related products such as compost, there is wide variation across countries and bodies mandated to set standards for safe disposal of organic wastes. More rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the level of contamination in chicken litter from both broilers and layers, especially in developing countries where there is hardly any data set standards for all the contaminants and standardize these standards across all agencies, for safe disposal of chicken litter on land.;0;Medi
Hysterical tetracycline in intensive poultry farms accountable for substantial gene resistance, health and ecological risk in Egypt-manure and fish;GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIAPRESSURIZED LIQUID EXTRACTIONESCHERICHIA-COLI STRAINSANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCEVETERINARY ANTIBIOTICSANTIBACTERIAL AGENTSBROILER-CHICKENSOXYTETRACYCLINESOILDETERMINANTS;Although the poultry production sector plays a key role in sustaining the majority of animal protein demand in Egypt, the deleterious effects of widespread antibiotic resistance on health and environment are currently not well recognized. Litter and dropping samples from broiler and layer poultry farms as well as, tilapia samples from the Nile River and aquaculture farms were collected from Upper Egypt. Samples were extracted and examined for tetracycline residues (tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxycycline (DC)] using HPLC. In addition, tetracycline resistance genes [tet (M), tet (W), tet (Q) and tet (G)] were screened from pooled intestinal contents collected from twelve broiler farms in Upper Egypt. The antibiotic resistance genes results revealed that tet (W) was confirmed to be expressed in all intestinal samples. In contrast, tet (Q) and tet (M) were detected only in 42% and 17% of the samples, respectively. CTC and OTC were the antimicrobial compounds with the highest concentrations in poultry litter and droppings, with concentrations of 6.05 and 2.47 mu g g(-1), (CTC) and 5.9 and 1.33 mu g g(-1) (OTC), respectively. However, the concentrations of DC were significantly higher than those of the other compounds in both aquaculture and Nile River tilapia. The tetracycline residue levels in aquaculture tilapia were significantly higher than those in Nile River tilapia. The hazard quotients (HQs) exceeded 1 for OTC, CTC and DC, which highlights the great risk of using broiler litter to fertilize agricultural land. Moreover, the presence of DC and CTC indicates that consumption of aquaculture tilapia poses a considerable health risk. Therefore, poultry litter or droppings containing tetracycline residues and tet resistance determinants used for aquaculture or as farmland fertilizers could be major sources of antibiotic resistance in fish, humans and environment.

Antibiotic Use in Agriculture and Its Consequential Resistance in Environmental Sources: Potential Public Health Implications;FOOD ANIMAL PRODUCTIONGRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIADRINKING-WATER SOURCESANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCEESCHERICHIA-COLISTAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUSSALMONELLA-ENTERICAPRODUCTION SYSTEMSMOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATIONTETRACYCLINE RESIDUES;Due to the increased demand of animal protein in developing countries, intensive farming is instigated, which results in antibiotic residues in animal-derived products, and eventually, antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is of great public health concern because the antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with the animals may be pathogenic to humans, easily transmitted to humans via food chains, and widely disseminated in the environment via animal wastes. These may cause complicated, untreatable, and prolonged infections in humans, leading to higher healthcare cost and sometimes death. In the said countries, antibiotic resistance is so complex and difficult, due to irrational use of antibiotics both in the clinical and agriculture settings, low socioeconomic status, poor sanitation and hygienic status, as well as that zoonotic bacterial pathogens are not regularly cultured, and their resistance to commonly used antibiotics are scarcely investigated (poor surveillance systems). The challenges that follow are of local, national, regional, and international dimensions, as there are no geographic boundaries to impede the spread of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the information assembled in this study through a thorough review of published findings, emphasized the presence of antibiotics in animal-derived products and the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in environmental samples. This therefore calls for strengthening of regulations that direct antibiotic manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and prescription, hence fostering antibiotic stewardship. Joint collaboration across the world with international bodies is needed to assist the developing countries to implement good surveillance of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance.;0;Medi
Molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus spp. from the farm-to-fork continuum in intensive poultry production in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa;ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCESTAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUSVIRULENCE FACTORSFAECALISFOODANIMALSCHAINIDENTIFICATIONFAECIUMSAMPLES;The poultry industry is among the main protein suppliers worldwide. Thus, this study determined the antibiotic resistance and virulence profiles of Enterococcus spp. along the farm-to-fork production chain of an intensive poultry system in the uMgungundlovu District, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Overall, 162 samples along the continuum (growth phase, transport and post-slaughter) were evaluated for the presence of Enterococcus spp. using selective media, biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance profiles were assessed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method following the WHO-AGISAR recommended antibiotics panel for Enterococcus spp. Antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were detected using real-time PCR. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by REP-PCR. Overall, 131 isolates were recovered across the continuum, (34% E. faecalis, 32% E. faecium, 2% E. gallinarum and 32% other Enterococcus spp.). Resistance to tetracycline (79%), erythromycin (70%), nitrofurantoin (18%), ampicillin (15%), streptomycin (15%), chloramphenicol (10%), ciprofloxacin (4%), tigecycline (4%), gentamicin (4%), teicoplanin (3%) was observed among all Enterococcus spp. no vancomycin resistance (0%) was recorded. Also, 24% of E. faedum were resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Twenty-four multidrug resistance (MDR) antibiograms were observed across all species: E. faecium (43%) showed the highest frequency of MDR. The most frequently observed antibiotic resistomes were tetM (76%) and ermB (66%) while smaller percentages were noted for aph(3')-IIIa (12%) and vanC1 (1%). Virulence genes efaAFs (100%), cpd (96%) and gelE (80%) were more prevalent in E. faecalis. Clonality revealed that isolates along the continuum were highly diverse with major REP-types consisting of isolates from the same sampling point. This study highlights the diversity MDR Enterococcus in the food chain with isolates harbouring resistance and virulence genes. These could be reservoirs for the potential transfer of pathogenic enterococci carrying these genes from poultry to humans through the food chain continuum, thus, underscoring the need for routine antibiotic resistance surveillance in food animals.

Exposure to Livestock Feces and Water Quality, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Conditions among Caregivers and Young Children: Formative Research in Rural Burkina Faso;ENVIRONMENTAL ENTEROPATHY FECAL CONTAMINATION DIARRHEA INFECTIONS RISK HOUSEHOLDS SHANTYTOWN PNEUMONIA GEOPHAGY POULTRY;Livestock farming is common in low-income settings as a source of income and animal-sourced food. However, there is growing evidence of the harmful health effects of proximity of animals to infants and young children, especially through exposure to zoonotic pathogens. Poultry ownership is almost universal in rural Burkina Faso. Poultry feces are a significant risk factor for enteric diseases that are associated with child undernutrition. To investigate the extent of exposure to livestock feces among young children and caregivers, we conducted direct observations of 20 caregiver-child dyads for a total of 80 hours (4 hours per dyad) and recorded water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related behaviors. We also undertook in-depth interviews with these caregivers and focus group discussions with separate groups of men and women who were poultry farmers. Poultry and other livestock feces were visible in all 20 and 19 households, respectively, in both kitchen areas and in the household courtyards where children frequently sit or crawl. Direct soil ingestion by young children was observed in almost half of the households (45%). Poor handwashing practices were also common among caregivers and children. Although latrines were available in almost all households, child feces disposal practices were inadequate. This body of research suggests an urgent need to adapt conventional WASH and livestock interventions to reduce the exposure of infants and young children to livestock feces.;0;Medi
Gut Resistome After Oral Antibiotics in Preschool Children in Burkina Faso: A Randomized, Controlled Trial;ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE;We evaluated the effect of systemic antibiotics (azithromycin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, or placebo) on the gut resistome in children aged 6 to 59 months. Azithromycin and cotrimoxazole led to an increase in macrolide and sulfonamide resistance determinants. Resistome expansion can be induced with a single course of antibiotics.;0;Medi
Effect of Commonly Used Pediatric Antibiotics on Gut Microbial Diversity in Preschool Children in Burkina Faso: A Randomized Clinical Trial;DOUBLE-BLIND AZITHROMYCIN COTRIMOXAZOLE ASSOCIATION PREVALENCE MORTALITY OBESITY;"Background. Exposure to antibiotics may result in alterations to the composition of intestinal microbiota. However, few trials have been conducted, and observational studies are subject to confounding by indication. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of 3 commonly used pediatric antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome in healthy preschool children.

Methods. Children aged 6-59 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to a 5-day course of 1 of 3 antibiotics, including amoxicillin (25 mg/kg/d twice-daily doses), azithromycin (10 mg/kg dose on day 1 and then 5 mg/kg once daily for 4 days), cotrimoxazole (240 mg once daily), or placebo. Rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and 5 days after the last dose and were processed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The prespecified primary outcome was inverse Simpson's alpha-diversity index.

Results. Post-treatment Simpson's diversity was significantly different across the 4 arms (P = .003). The mean Simpson's alpha-diversity among azithromycin-treated children was significantly lower than in placebo-treated children (6.6 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-7.8 vs 9.8 95% CI, 8.7-10.9 P = .0001). Diversity in children treated with amoxicillin (8.3 95% CI, 7.0-9.6 P = .09) or cotrimoxazole (8.3 95% CI, 8.2-9.7 P = .08) was not significantly different than placebo.

Conclusions. Azithromycin affects the composition of the pediatric intestinal microbiome. The effect of amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole on microbiome composition was less clear";0;Medi
Household Animal and Human Medicine Use and Animal Husbandry Practices in Rural Bangladesh: Risk Factors for Emerging Zoonotic Disease and Antibiotic Resistance;"PERUVIAN SHANTYTOWNANTIMICROBIAL USEESCHERICHIA-COLIFOOD ANIMALSCOMMUNITYPOULTRYHEALTHDISTRICTCHILDRENWORKERS
Author Information";Animal antimicrobial use and husbandry practices increase risk of emerging zoonotic disease and antibiotic resistance. We surveyed 700 households to elicit information on human and animal medicine use and husbandry practices. Households that owned livestock (n=265/459, 57.7%) reported using animal treatments 630 times during the previous 6months 57.6% obtained medicines, including antibiotics, from drug sellers. Government animal healthcare providers were rarely visited (9.7%), and respondents more often sought animal health care from pharmacies and village doctors (70.6% and 11.9%, respectively), citing the latter two as less costly and more successful based on past performance. Animal husbandry practices that could promote the transmission of microbes from animals to humans included the following: the proximity of chickens to humans (50.1% of households reported that the chickens slept in the bedroom) the shared use of natural bodies of water for human and animal bathing (78.3%) the use of livestock waste as fertilizer (60.9%) and gender roles that dictate that females are the primary caretakers of poultry and children (62.8%). In the absence of an effective animal healthcare system, villagers must depend on informal healthcare providers for treatment of their animals. Suboptimal use of antimicrobials coupled with unhygienic animal husbandry practices is an important risk factor for emerging zoonotic disease and resistant pathogens.;0;Medi
Human, animal and environmental contributors to antibiotic resistance in low-resource settings: integrating behavioural, epidemiological and One Health approaches;SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASEHOSPITAL WASTE-WATERESCHERICHIA-COLIANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCECHINESE SWINEGENESPREVALENCEPOULTRYTRENDSSPREAD;Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is recognized as a One Health challenge because of the rapid emergence and dissemination of resistant bacteria and genes among humans, animals and the environment on a global scale. However, there is a paucity of research assessing ABR contemporaneously in humans, animals and the environment in low-resource settings. This critical review seeks to identify the extent of One Health research on ABR in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Existing research has highlighted hotspots for environmental contamination food-animal production systems that are likely to harbour reservoirs or promote transmission of ABR as well as high and increasing human rates of colonization with ABR commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli. However, very few studies have integrated all three components of the One Health spectrum to understand the dynamics of transmission and the prevalence of community-acquired resistance in humans and animals. Microbiological, epidemiological and social science research is needed at community and population levels across the One Health spectrum in order to fill the large gaps in knowledge of ABR in low-resource settings.;0;Medi
Effect of Antibiotics on Short-Term Growth among Children in Burkina Faso: A Randomized Trial;SEVERE ACUTE MALNUTRITION MASS TREATMENT DOUBLE-BLIND GUT MICROBIOTA AZITHROMYCIN MORTALITY EXPOSURE MALARIA COTRIMOXAZOLE CHILDHOOD;Antibiotics improve both weight and height gain in randomized trials of preschool children with preexisting morbidity. Here, we assess the effect of a short course of three different antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin, and cotrimoxazole) on short-term linear and ponderal growth in a population-based sample of preschool children in rural Burkina Faso. We randomized households with at least two children in the Nouna district, Burkina Faso, to a 5-day course of amoxicillin, azithromycin, cotrimoxazole, or placebo. Within each antibiotic-randomized household, one child was randomly assigned to receive the antibiotic and the other to receive the placebo. Weight and height measurements were taken at baseline and 30 days following the last study medication dose. Weight-for-height Z (WHZ), height-for-age Z (HAZ), and weight-for-age Z (WAZ) scores were calculated based on the 2006 World Health Organization standards. Of the 124 households and 248 children enrolled, 229 had anthropometry measurements at 1 month and were analyzed. Children randomized to amoxicillin gained significantly more weight compared with both the placebo household (mean difference 317 g, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 115-519 g) and placebo sibling (mean difference 315 g, 95% CI: 147-482 g) controls. Growth velocity in g/kg/day, and WHZ and WAZ scores were higher in amoxicillin-treated children compared with placebo households and siblings. There were no differences in weight gain in children randomized to azithromycin or cotrimoxazole compared with placebo households or placebo siblings. There were no differences in height gain or HAZ across any of the study arms. Amoxicillin may have short-term growth-promoting effects in healthy children.;0;Medi
Dietary diversity and nutritional status among children in rural Burkina Faso;RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALMIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIESMALARIAUNDERNUTRITIONMALNUTRITIONCHILDHOODPREDICTORGROWTH;"Background: Burkina Faso has a seasonal malnutrition pattern, with higher malnutrition prevalence during the rainy season when crop yields are low. We investigated the association between dietary diversity and nutritional status among children aged 6-59 mo during the low crop yield season in rural Burkina Faso to assess the role of dietary diversity during the lean season on childhood nutritional status.

Methods: Caregivers reported the dietary diversity of the past 7 d, consisting of 11 food groups, summed into a scale. Anthropometric measurements were taken from all children. Height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) z-scores were calculated based on 2006 WHO standards. Stunting, wasting and underweight were defined as HAZ, WHZ and WAZ <-2 SD, respectively. Multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders including household food insecurity and animal ownership were used to assess the relationship between anthropometric indices and dietary diversity.

Results: Of 251 children enrolled in the study, 20.6% were stunted, 10.0% wasted and 13.9% underweight. Greater dietary diversity was associated with greater HAZ (SD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25) among all children. There was no association between dietary diversity and wasting or mid-upper arm circumference in this study.

Conclusions: Increasing dietary diversity may be an approach to reduce the burden of stunting and chronic malnutrition among young children in regions with seasonal food insecurity.";0;Medi
The analyses of human inherited disease and tissue-specific proteins in the interaction network;HUMAN PROTEOME GENES MEDICINE DRAFT;"Objectives: With the announcement of human proteome and interaction data, it becomes possible to comprehensively investigate the tissue-expression and network properties of inherited disease proteins. In this study, our goal was to develop methods to map the disease and expression data and analyze the disorder-tissue associations.

Methods: In this paper, we manually classified the human disease proteins into 22 disorder classes and systematically analyzed the properties of disease proteins in different disorder classes. Then, we investigated the similarity of different disorder classes by computing the overlap of different disorder proteins and networks. We proposed two novel measures, Enrichment Ratio and P-value for comparative analysis of disease proteins across tissues and revealed the associations between disorder classes and tissues/cells.

Results: Compared with non-disease proteins, disease proteins tend to express in more tissues, have higher expression levels and interact with more other proteins in the network. The overlap percentages of networks are much higher than those of proteins, implying that different disorder classes usually influence each other by means of their interacting neighbors. The metabolic, muscular and hematologic proteins are related with most tissues/cells, and cancer proteins are closely associated with the disorders in immune cells.

Conclusion: This paper provided novel methods to investigate proteome-wide disease proteins and their interacting networks in order to understand different disease's associations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";1;Medi
Network medicine: a network-based approach to human disease;PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORK GENE-COEXPRESSION NETWORK TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES COMMUNITY STRUCTURE MOLECULAR NETWORKS SMALL-WORLD INTERACTOME CANCER MODULARITY DISCOVERY;Given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.;0;Medi
Comparative Analysis of Human Tissue Interactomes Reveals Factors Leading to Tissue-Specific Manifestation of Hereditary Diseases;BETA-DYSTROGLYCAN GENE-EXPRESSION DATABASE NETWORKS CANCER IDENTIFICATION ASSOCIATION MUTATIONS PATHOLOGY DOMAIN;An open question in human genetics is what underlies the tissue-specific manifestation of hereditary diseases, which are caused by genomic aberrations that are present in cells across the human body. Here we analyzed this phenomenon for over 300 hereditary diseases by using comparative network analysis. We created an extensive resource of protein expression and interactions in 16 main human tissues, by integrating recent data of gene and protein expression across tissues with data of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The resulting tissue interaction networks (interactomes) shared a large fraction of their proteins and PPIs, and only a small fraction of them were tissue-specific. Applying this resource to hereditary diseases, we first show that most of the disease-causing genes are widely expressed across tissues, yet, enigmatically, cause disease phenotypes in few tissues only. Upon testing for factors that could lead to tissue-specific vulnerability, we find that disease-causing genes tend to have elevated transcript levels and increased number of tissue-specific PPIs in their disease tissues compared to unaffected tissues. We demonstrate through several examples that these tissue-specific PPIs can highlight disease mechanisms, and thus, owing to their small number, provide a powerful filter for interrogating disease etiologies. As two thirds of the hereditary diseases are associated with these factors, comparative tissue analysis offers a meaningful and efficient framework for enhancing the understanding of the molecular basis of hereditary diseases.;0;Medi
Tissue specificity and the human protein interaction network;YEAST MAP EXPRESSION RESOURCE MOUSE COMPLEXES FRAMEWORK DATABASE REVEALS;A protein interaction network describes a set of physical associations that can occur between proteins. However, within any particular cell or tissue only a subset of proteins is expressed and so only a subset of interactions can occur. Integrating interaction and expression data, we analyze here this interplay between protein expression and physical interactions in humans. Proteins only expressed in restricted cell types, like recently evolved proteins, make few physical interactions. Most tissue-specific proteins do, however, bind to universally expressed proteins, and so can function by recruiting or modifying core cellular processes. Conversely, most 'housekeeping' proteins that are expressed in all cells also make highly tissue-specific protein interactions. These results suggest a model for the evolution of tissue-specific biology, and show that most, and possibly all, 'housekeeping' proteins actually have important tissue-specific molecular interactions.

Exploring the human diseasome: the human disease network;PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORK MOLECULAR-BASIS COMPLEX INTERACTOME DISORDERS MEDICINE GENES BIOLOGY;Advances in genome-scale molecular biology and molecular genetics have greatly elevated our knowledge on the basic components of human biology and diseases. At the same time, the importance of cellular networks between those biological components is increasingly appreciated. Built upon these recent technological and conceptual advances, a new discipline called the network medicine, an approach to understand human diseases from a network point-of-view, is about to emerge. In this review article, we will survey some recent endeavours along this direction, centred on the concept and applications of the human diseasome and the human disease network. Questions, and partial answers thereof, such as how the connectivity between molecular parts translates into the relationships between the related disorders on a global scale and how central the disease-causing genetic components are in the cellular network, will be discussed. The use of the diseasome in combination with various interactome networks and other disease-related factors is also reviewed.;0;Medi
The human disease network;PROTEIN INTERACTION NETWORK TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES GENES INTERACTOME MODULARITY GENOMICS BIOLOGY YEAST;A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations offers a platform to explore in a single graph-theoretic framework all known phenotype and disease gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.;0;Medi

";The use of networks to integrate different genetic, proteomic, and metabolic datasets has been proposed as a viable path toward elucidating the origins of specific diseases. Here we introduce a new phenotypic database summarizing correlations obtained from the disease history of more than 30 million patients in a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). We present evidence that the structure of the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing that (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already have (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is different for patients of different genders and ethnicities (3) patients diagnosed with diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases and (4) diseases that tend to be preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than diseases that precede other illnesses, and are associated with higher degrees of mortality. Our findings show that disease progression can be represented and studied using network methods, offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of human diseases. The dataset introduced here, released concurrently with this publication, represents the largest relational phenotypic resource publicly available to the research community.;0;Medi

Such tools enabled conceptually different approaches for exploring human diseases to be undertaken, in particular, those that study the relationship between a multitude of biomolecules within a cell. Hence, a new field of network biology has emerged as part of systems biology, aiming to untangle the complexity of cellular network organization. We survey current network analysis methods that aim to give insight into human disease.;0;Medi
A draft map of the human proteome;IDENTIFICATION DATABASE KNOWLEDGE PROTEINS PROJECT TANDEM;The availability of human genome sequence has transformed biomedical research over the past decade. However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames. This large human proteome catalogue ( available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.;0;Medi
A large-scale analysis of tissue-specific pathology and gene expression of human disease genes and complexes;PROTEIN COMPLEXES SEX-DETERMINATION STEROIDOGENIC FACTOR-1 INTERACTION NETWORK MOUSE SOX9 DAX1 SRY DIFFERENTIATION IDENTIFICATION;Heritable diseases are caused by germ-line mutations that, despite tissuewide presence, often lead to tissue-specific pathology. Here, we make a systematic analysis of the link between tissue-specific gene expression and pathological manifestations in many human diseases and cancers. Diseases were systematically mapped to tissues they affect from disease-relevant literature in PubMed to create a disease-tissue covariation matrix of high-confidence associations of > 1,000 diseases to 73 tissues. By retrieving > 2,000 known disease genes, and generating 1,500 disease-associated protein complexes, we analyzed the differential expression of a gene or complex involved in a particular disease in the tissues affected by the disease, compared with nonaffected tissues. When this analysis is scaled to all diseases in our dataset, there is a significant tendency for disease genes and complexes to be overexpressed in the normal tissues where defects cause pathology. In contrast, cancer genes and complexes were not overexpressed in the tissues from which the tumors emanate. We specifically identified a complex involved in XY sex reversal that is testis-specific and down-regulated in ovaries. We also identified complexes in Parkinson disease, cardiomyopathies, and muscular dystrophy syndromes that are similarly tissue specific. Our method represents a conceptual scaffold for organism-spanning analyses and reveals an extensive list of tissue-specific draft molecular pathways, both known and unexpected, that might be disrupted in disease.;0;Medi
Construction and Analyses of Human Large-Scale Tissue Specific Networks;biological systems  proteome-wide networks human  protein dynamics;Construction and analyses of tissue specific networks is crucial to unveil the function and organizational structure of biological systems. As a direct method to detect protein dynamics, human proteome-wide expression data provide an valuable resource to investigate the tissue specificity of proteins and interactions. By integrating protein expression data with large-scale interaction network, we constructed 30 tissue/cell specific networks in human and analyzed their properties and functions. Rather than the tissue specificity of proteins, we mainly focused on the tissue specificity of interactions to distill tissue specific networks. Through comparing our tissue specific networks with those inferred from gene expression data, we found our networks have larger scales and higher reliability. Furthermore, we investigated the similar extent of multiple tissue specific networks, which proved that tissues with similar functions tend to contain more common interactions. Finally, we found that the tissue specific networks differed from the static network in multiple topological properties. The proteins in tissue specific networks are interacting looser and the hubs play more important roles than those in the static network.;0;Medi
Enhancing the Prioritization of Disease-Causing Genes through Tissue Specific Protein Interaction Networks;GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION LARGE-SCALE ANALYSIS RECONSTRUCTION EXPRESSION PREDICTION MODELS RESOURCE SEQUENCE MOUSE;The prioritization of candidate disease-causing genes is a fundamental challenge in the post-genomic era. Current state of the art methods exploit a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for this task. They are based on the observation that genes causing phenotypically-similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a PPI network. However, to date, these methods have used a static picture of human PPIs, while diseases impact specific tissues in which the PPI networks may be dramatically different. Here, for the first time, we perform a large-scale assessment of the contribution of tissue-specific information to gene prioritization. By integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information, we construct tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 tissues and investigate their prioritization power. We find that tissue-specific PPI networks considerably improve the prioritization results compared to those obtained using a generic PPI network. Furthermore, they allow predicting novel disease-tissue associations, pointing to sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection.;0;Medi
iRefIndex: A consolidated protein interaction database with provenance;SEQUENCE IDENTIFIERS INTERACTION MAP NETWORK COMPLEXES SOFTWARE BIND;"Background: Interaction data for a given protein may be spread across multiple databases. We set out to create a unifying index that would facilitate searching for these data and that would group together redundant interaction data while recording the methods used to perform this grouping.

Results: We present a method to generate a key for a protein interaction record and a key for each participant protein. These keys may be generated by anyone using only the primary sequence of the proteins, their taxonomy identifiers and the Secure Hash Algorithm. Two interaction records will have identical keys if they refer to the same set of identical protein sequences and taxonomy identifiers. We define records with identical keys as a redundant group. Our method required that we map protein database references found in interaction records to current protein sequence records. Operations performed during this mapping are described by a mapping score that may provide valuable feedback to source interaction databases on problematic references that are malformed, deprecated, ambiguous or unfound. Keys for protein participants allow for retrieval of interaction information independent of the protein references used in the original records.

Conclusion: We have applied our method to protein interaction records from BIND, BioGrid, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, MPact, MPPI and OPHID. The resulting interaction reference index is provided in PSI-MITAB 2.5 format at http://irefindex.uio.no. This index may form the basis of alternative redundant groupings based on gene identifiers or near sequence identity groupings.";0;Medi
Mining tissue specificity, gene connectivity and disease association to reveal a set of genes that modify the action of disease causing genes;COEXPRESSION NETWORKS EXPRESSION INFLAMMATION ATLAS;"Background: The tissue specificity of gene expression has been linked to a number of significant outcomes including level of expression, and differential rates of polymorphism, evolution and disease association. Recent studies have also shown the importance of exploring differential gene connectivity and sequence conservation in the identification of disease-associated genes. However, no study relates gene interactions with tissue specificity and disease association.

Methods: We adopted an a priori approach making as few assumptions as possible to analyse the interplay among gene-gene interactions with tissue specificity and its subsequent likelihood of association with disease. We mined three large datasets comprising expression data drawn from massively parallel signature sequencing across 32 tissues, describing a set of 55,606 true positive interactions for 7,197 genes, and microarray expression results generated during the profiling of systemic inflammation, from which 126,543 interactions among 7,090 genes were reported.

Results: Amongst the myriad of complex relationships identified between expression, disease, connectivity and tissue specificity, some interesting patterns emerged. These include elevated rates of expression and network connectivity in housekeeping and disease-associated tissue-specific genes. We found that disease-associated genes are more likely to show tissue specific expression and most frequently interact with other disease genes. Using the thresholds defined in these observations, we develop a guilt-by-association algorithm and discover a group of 112 non-disease annotated genes that predominantly interact with disease-associated genes, impacting on disease outcomes.

Conclusion: We conclude that parameters such as tissue specificity and network connectivity can be used in combination to identify a group of genes, not previously confirmed as disease causing, that are involved in interactions with disease causing genes. Our guilt-by-association algorithm should be useful for the discovery of additional modifiers of genetic diseases, and more generally, for the ability to associate genes of unknown function to clusters of genes with defined functions allowing for novel biological inference that can be subsequently validated.";0;Medi
Mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome;GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR NONCODING RNAS IDENTIFICATION EXPRESSION QUANTIFICATION PROTEINS DATABASE REVEALS PEPTIDE PROJECT;Proteomes are characterized by large protein-abundance differences, cell-type- and time-dependent expression patterns and post-translational modifications, all of which carry biological information that is not accessible by genomics or transcriptomics. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome and a public, high-performance, in-memory database for real-time analysis of terabytes of big data, called ProteomicsDB. The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology.;0;Medi
Ischemic Preconditioning and Muscle Force Capabilities;PERFORMANCE HUMANS VASODILATION MEDICINE SPORTS POWER;Valenzuela, PL, Martin-Candilejo, R, Sanchez-Martinez, G, Bouzas Marins, JC, de la Villa, P, and Sillero-Quintana, M. Ischemic preconditioning and muscle force capabilities. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2187-2192, 2021-This study analyzed the effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on muscle force capabilities. Sixteen male subjects participated in this randomized, crossover, sham-controlled study. They were assigned to either IPC (3 x 5 minutes at 220 mm Hg in both arms with 5-minute rests) or a sham intervention (SHAM) (occlusion pressure set at 10 mm Hg). Forty minutes later, their force capabilities on the bench press exercise were assessed (load-velocity relationship with light, moderate, and heavy loads [30, 50, and 70% body mass, respectively] 1 repetition maximum [1RM] and number of repetitions to failure in 3 sets with 60% RM). The skin temperature (Tsk) of the pectoral and biceps muscles was analyzed as a secondary endpoint by means of infrared thermography. A significant decrease in the Tsk of the pectoral and biceps muscles was observed after the intervention (p < 0.01) and before the warm-up (p < 0.05) in IPC, but not in SHAM. However, exercise resulted in a similar Tsk increase in the pectoral muscles in both conditions (p > 0.05). No significant differences (p > 0.05 for all) were observed between conditions in the mean velocity attained with light (1.11 +/- 0.11 and 1.09 +/- 0.14 m center dot s(-1), respectively), moderate (0.83 +/- 0.14 and 0.83 +/- 0.16 m center dot s(-1)), nor heavy loads (0.56 +/- 0.17 and 0.54 +/- 0.16 m center dot s(-1)), in 1RM (75.0 +/- 18.9 and 73.1 +/- 15.0 kg for IPC and SHAM, respectively p = 0.181), nor in the number of repetitions performed (52 +/- 13 and 54 +/- 16 repetitions, p = 0.492). In summary, IPC decreased Tsk locally (biceps) and remotely (pectoral). However, it did not alter muscle force capabilities nor the Tsk response to exercise.;1;Medi
Are the Beneficial Effects of Ischemic Preconditioning on Performance Partly a Placebo Effect?;FRONT-CRAWL ANAEROBIC PERFORMANCE EXERCISE HUMANS RECOVERY SPORT;The acute effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on the maximal performance in the 100-m freestyle event was studied in recreational swimmers. 15 swimmers (21.0 +/- 3.2years) participated in a random crossover model on 3 different days (control [CON], IPC or SHAM), separated by 3-5 days. IPC consisted of 4 cycles of 5-min occlusion (220mmHg)/5-min reperfusion in each arm, and the SHAM protocol was similar to IPC but with only 20mmHg during the occlusion phase. The subjects were informed that both maneuvers (IPC and SHAM) would improve their performance. After IPC, CON or SHAM, the volunteers performed a maximal 100-m time trial. IPC improved performance (p=0.036) compared to CON. SHAM performance was only better than CON (p=0.059) as a tendency but did not differ from IPC performance. The individual response of the subjects to the different maneuvers was very heterogeneous. We conclude that IPC may improve performance in recreational swimmers, but this improvement could mainly be a placebo effect.;0;Medi
Preconditioning Strategies to Enhance Physical Performance on the Day of Competition;POST-ACTIVATION POTENTIATION PROFESSIONAL RUGBY PLAYERS BODY POWER OUTPUT WARM-UP MUSCLE TEMPERATURE RECOVERY-TIME RUNNING PERFORMANCE SPRINT PERFORMANCE SQUAT PERFORMANCE EXERCISE;Sports scientists and strength and conditioning professionals spend the majority of the competition season trying to ensure that their athletes' training and recovery strategies are appropriate to ensure optimal performance on competition day. However, there is an additional window on the day of competition where performance can be acutely enhanced with a number of preconditioning strategies. These strategies include appropriately designed warm-up, passive heat maintenance, postactivation potentiation, remote ischemic preconditioning, and, more recently, prior exercise and hormonal priming. The aim of this review was to explore the potential practical use of these strategies and propose a theoretical timeline outlining how they may be incorporated into athlete's precompetition routine to enhance performance. For the purpose of this review the discussion is confined to strategies that may enhance performance of short-duration, high-intensity sports (eg, sprinting, jumping, throwing).;0;Medi

Sex-Specific Impact of Ischemic Preconditioning on Tissue Oxygenation and Maximal Concentric Force;HUMAN SKELETAL-MUSCLE GENDER-DIFFERENCES FATIGUE EXERCISE PERFORMANCE RESPONSES MEN VASODILATION REPERFUSION ACTIVATION;Prior peripheral hypoxia induced via remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve physical performance in male athletes through improved O-2 delivery and utilization. Since females may have an innate protective mechanism against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and since muscle metabolism during contraction differs between sexes, it is relevant to examine the impact of sex in response to IPC to determine whether it is also ergogenic in females. In a randomized, crossover, single-blind study, we investigated muscle performance, hemodynamic and O-2 uptake in strength-trained males (n = 9) and females (n = 8) performing five sets of 5 maximum voluntary knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer, preceded by either IPC (3 x 5-min ischemia/5-min reperfusion cycles at 200 mmHg) or SHAM (20 mmHg). Changes in deoxy-hemoglobin (Delta[HHb], expressed in percentage of arterial occlusion and considered an index of O-2 extraction), and total hemoglobin (Delta[THb]) concentrations of the vastus lateralis muscle were continuously monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. The metabolic efficiency of the contractions was calculated as the average force/Delta[HHb](avg) ratio. Cohen's effect sizes (ES) +/- 90% confidence limits were used to estimate IPC-induced changes and sex differences. IPC increased total muscular force in males only (13.0%, ES 0.64, 0.370.90), and this change was greater than in females (10.4% difference, ES 0.40, 0.100.70). Percent force decrement was only attenuated in females (-19.8%, ES -0.38, -0.770.01), which was clearly different than males (sex difference: ES 0.45, -0.161.07). IPC also induced different changes between sexes for average muscle O-2 uptake in set 2 (males: 6.4% vs. females: -16.7%, ES 0.21, -0.180.60), set 3 (males: 7.0% vs. females: -44.4%, ES 0.56, -0.171.29), set 4 (males: 9.1% vs. females: -40.2%, ES 0.51, -0.101.13), and set 5 (males: 10.2% vs. females: -40.4%, ES 0.52, -0.041.09). However, metabolic efficiency was not meaningfully different between conditions and sexes. IPC increased muscle blood volume (up arrow[THb]) at rest and during recovery between sets, to the same extent in both sexes. Despite a similar IPC-induced initial increase in O-2 delivery in both sexes, males displayed greater peripheral O-2 extraction and greater strength enhancement. This ergogenic effect appears to be mediated in part via an up regulated oxidative function in males. We conclude that strength-trained males might benefit more from IPC than their female counterparts during repeated, maximal efforts.;0;Medi
Effect of ischemic preconditioning in skeletal muscle measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy: a randomized crossover trial;OXYGENATION CHANGES RECOVERY OVERSHOOT REACTIVE HYPEREMIA P-31 MRS IN-VIVO REPERFUSION HUMANS INJURY BLOOD QUANTIFICATION;"Background: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and spectroscopy have been applied to assess skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. Therefore, in-vivo NMR may enable the characterization of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether NMR could detect the effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in healthy subjects.

Methods: Twenty-three participants were included in two randomized crossover protocols in which the effects of IPC were measured by NMR and muscle force assessments. Leg ischemia was administered for 20 minutes with or without a subsequent impaired reperfusion for 5 minutes (stenosis model). IPC was administered 4 or 48 hours prior to ischemia. Changes in (31)phosphate NMR spectroscopy and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were recorded. 3-Tesla NMR data were compared to those obtained for isometric muscular strength.

Results: The phosphocreatine (PCr) signal decreased robustly during ischemia and recovered rapidly during reperfusion. In contrast to PCr, the recovery of muscular strength was slow. During post-ischemic stenosis, PCr increased only slightly. The BOLD signal intensity decreased during ischemia, ischemic exercise and post-ischemic stenosis but increased during hyperemic reperfusion. IPC 4 hours prior to ischemia significantly increased the maximal PCr reperfusion signal and mitigated the peak BOLD signal during reperfusion.

Conclusions: Ischemic preconditioning positively influenced muscle metabolism during reperfusion this resulted in an increase in PCr production and higher oxygen consumption, thereby mitigating the peak BOLD signal. In addition, an impairment of energy replenishment during the low-flow reperfusion was detected in this model. Thus, functional NMR is capable of characterizing changes in reperfusion and in therapeutic interventions in vivo.";0;Medi
Effects of ischemic preconditioning on maximal constant-load cycling performance;SKELETAL-MUSCLE FATIGUE OXYGEN-UPTAKE KINETICS SLOW COMPONENT O-2 UPTAKE PROGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT EXERCISE PERFORMANCE SPORTS-MEDICINE BRACHIAL-ARTERY BLOOD-FLOW TIME;This study investigated the effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), surface electromyography, and pulmonary oxygen uptake ((V) over dot(O2)) onset kinetics during cycling until exhaustion at the peak power output attained during an incremental test. A group of 12 recreationally trained cyclists volunteered for this study. After determination of peak power output during an incremental test, they were randomly subjected on different days to a performance protocol preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff pressure inflation to 220 mmHg (IPC) or 20 mmHg (control). To increase data reliability, the performance visits were replicated, also in a random manner. There was an 8.0% improvement in performance after IPC (control: 303 s, IPC 327 s, factor SDs of X/divided by 1.13, P = 0.01). This change was followed by a 2.9% increase in peak (V) over dot(O2) (control: 3.95 l/min, IPC: 4.06 l/min, factor SDs of X/divided by 1.15, P = 0.04), owing to a higher amplitude of the slow component of the (V) over dot(O2) kinetics (control: 0.45 l/min, IPC: 0.63 l/min, factor SDs of X/divided by 2.21, P = 0.05). There was also an attenuation in the rate of increase in RPE (P = 0.01) and a progressive increase in the myoelectrical activity of the vastus lateralis muscle (P = 0.04). Furthermore, the changes in peak (V) over dot(O2) (r = 0.73, P = 0.007) and the amplitude of the slow component (r = 0.79, P = 0.002) largely correlated with performance improvement. These findings provide a link between improved aerobic metabolism and enhanced severe-intensity cycling performance after IPC. Furthermore, the delayed exhaustion after IPC under lower RPE and higher skeletal muscle activation suggest they have a role on the ergogenic effects of IPC on endurance performance.;0;Medi

IPC has also been proposed as a novel intervention to improve exercise performance in healthy and diseased populations.

Objective The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the evidence for IPC improving exercise performance in healthy humans.

Methods Data were obtained using a systematic computer-assisted search of four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL), from January 1985 to October 2015, and relevant reference lists.

Results Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The collective data suggest that IPC is a safe intervention that may be capable of improving time-trial performance. Available individual data from included studies demonstrate that IPC improved time-trial performance in 67 % of participants, with comparable results in athletes and recreationally active populations. The effects of IPC on power output, oxygen consumption, rating of perceived exertion, blood lactate accumulation, and cardiorespiratory measures are unclear. The within-study heterogeneity may suggest the presence of IPC responders and non-responders, which in combination with small sample sizes, likely confound interpretation of mean group data in the literature.

Conclusion The ability of IPC to improve time-trial performance is promising, but the potential mechanisms responsible require further investigation. Future work should be directed toward identifying the individual phenotype and protocol that will best exploit IPC-mediated exercise performance improvements, facilitating its application in sport settings.";0;Medi
Ischemic Preconditioning and Exercise Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;PERIPHERAL MUSCLE FATIGUE ANAEROBIC PERFORMANCE ADENOSINE RECEPTOR BRACHIAL-ARTERY BLOOD-FLOW MECHANISMS INJURY MICROCIRCULATION MYOCARDIUM METABOLISM;Although the amount of evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on exercise performance is increasing, conclusions about its efficacy cannot yet be drawn. Therefore, the purposes of this review were to determine the effect of IPC on exercise performance and identify the effects of different IPC procedures, exercise types, and subject characteristics on exercise performance. The analysis comprised 19 relevant studies from 2000 to 2015, 15 of which were included in the meta-analyses. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated as the standardized mean difference. Overall, IPC had a small beneficial effect on exercise performance (ES = 0.43 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.51). The largest ES were found for aerobic (ES = 0.51 90% CI, 0.35 to 0.67) and anaerobic (ES = 0.23 90% CI, -0.12 to 0.58) exercise. In contrast, an unclear effect was observed in power and sprint performance (ES = 0.16 90% CI, -0.20 to 0.52). In conclusion, IPC can effectively enhance aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance.;0;Medi

Therefore a systematic review was performed, including a meta-analysis and evaluation of the quality of the papers that addressed this scope. The electronic databases of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Google Scholar (using [advanced search], [all fields]) and other online journals were searched, for the following descriptors: a) ischemic preconditioning b) blood flow and hyperemia c) blood flow occlusion, combined with exercise performance, athletes, exercise and performance. Relevant studies were included, if they conformed to strict pre-formulated criteria, excluding systematic review articles, meta-analyses and studies with only animals or non-healthy subjects. The 20 studies included had high quality scores (87%). The majority of the studies lacked statistical significance (P<0.05) for both performance and physiological variables when comparing IPC, placebo and control groups. Most studies showed that IPC has no significant influence on performance. The few studies with significant differences mainly described an improvement only in performance without altered physiological parameters. Therefore, the influence of IPC on performance is still unclear and physiologically highly debatable.;0;Medi
Remote ischemic preconditioning delays fatigue development during handgrip exercise;NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY SKELETAL-MUSCLE BLOOD-FLOW OXYGEN-UPTAKE PROTECTS RESPONSES HUMANS ARTERY TIME EMG;Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of one or two limbs improves performance of exercise that recruits the same limb(s). However, it is unclear whether IPC application to another limb than that in exercise is also effective and which mechanisms are involved. We investigated the effect of remote IPC (RIPC) on muscle fatigue, time to task failure, forearm hemodynamics, and deoxygenation during handgrip exercise. Thirteen men underwent RIPC in the lower limbs or a control intervention (CON), in random order, and then performed a constant load rhythmic handgrip protocol until task failure. Rates of contraction and relaxation (Force/Time) were used as indices of fatigue. Brachial artery blood flow and conductance, besides forearm microvascular deoxygenation, were assessed during exercise. RIPC attenuated the slowing of contraction and relaxation throughout exercise (P<0.05 vs CON) and increased time to task failure by 11.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.7-21.7%, P<0.05 vs CON). There was no significant difference in blood flow, conductance, and deoxygenation between conditions throughout exercise (P>0.05). In conclusion, RIPC applied to the lower limbs delayed the development of fatigue during handgrip exercise, prolonged time to task failure, but was not accompanied by changes in forearm hemodynamics and deoxygenation.;0;Medi
The effect of ischaemic preconditioning on central and peripheral fatiguing mechanisms in humans following sustained maximal isometric exercise;CYCLING PERFORMANCE SKELETAL-MUSCLE VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS OXYGEN-UPTAKE NITRIC-OXIDE BLOOD-FLOW RELIABILITY ACTIVATION AFFERENTS PRESSURE;Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) is thought to inhibit neural feedback from metabolically sensitive muscle afferents during exercise. It was hypothesized that IPC could affect mechanisms associated with centrally mediated fatigue after a maximally fatiguing protocol. Eleven resistance-trained men completed three 2min maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) via an isometric leg extension preceded by treatments of IPC (three bouts of 5min bilateral leg occlusions at 220mmHg), SHAM (three bouts of 5min at 20mmHg) or CON (30min passive rest). Femoral nerve stimulation was used to explore central and peripheral fatigue pathways. These pathways were profiled at baseline (BL), before the 2min MVC (Pre) and 10s afterwards (Post). Tissue oxygenation was measured throughout the 2min MVCs via near-infrared spectroscopy. The Pre to Post MVC (-71 +/- 56 Nm d=1.33 +/- 0.51, P<0.01) and twitch torque (-51 +/- 20Nm d=3.76 +/- 0.84, P<0.01) levels declined without differences between conditions (MVC, P=0.67 twitch torque, P=0.39). Voluntary activation was also unaffected by condition (P=0.80). Peak deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations were elevated in the IPC trials relative to CON (3.7 +/- 3.0moll(-1) d=1.02 +/- 0.46, P<0.01) and SHAM (3.0 +/- 3.7moll(-1) d=0.82 +/- 0.57, P<0.05). These findings demonstrate that IPC does not affect central or peripherally mediated mechanisms of fatigue during a sustained 2min maximal effort isometric leg-extension task.;0;Medi
Beneficial Effects of Ischemic Preconditioning in Resistance Exercise Fade Over Time;ANAEROBIC PERFORMANCE PLACEBO RECOVERY INTENSITY VOLUME;This study evaluated the effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on resistance exercise performance in upper limbs. After 12-RM load determination, 21 men attended 4 trials separated by 3 days in a randomized crossover design: IPC (4x5-min occlusion 220mmHg/reperfusion 0mmHg) in arms and in thighs, and SHAM (equal to the IPC protocol but occlusion at 20mmHg) in arms and in thighs. 8min following the respective interventions, the subjects performed one set of resistance exercise in elbow flexion with the 12-RM load until concentric failure. The number of repetitions increased for both protocols in arm (IPC=14.1 +/- 2.5 and SHAM=14.4 +/- 3.0) and in thigh (IPC=14.3 +/- 2.2 and SHAM=13.4 +/- 1.7). However, the number of repetitions tended to decrease over the 4 trials and no more effect was found in the fourth trial. Therefore, IPC or SHAM may enhance performance in resistance exercise for upper limbs, but this effect apparently fades over time.;0;Medi
Ischemic Preconditioning and Placebo Intervention Improves Resistance Exercise Performance;ANAEROBIC PERFORMANCE RECOVERY INTENSITY OCCLUSION RESPONSES VOLUME ORDER;Marocolo, M, Willardson, JM, Marocolo, IC, da Mota, GR, SimAo, R, and Maior, AS. Ischemic preconditioning and PLACEBO intervention improves resistance exercise performance. J Strength Cond Res 30(5): 1462-1469, 2016This study evaluated the effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on resistance exercise performance in the lower limbs. Thirteen men participated in a randomized crossover design that involved 3 separate sessions (IPC, PLACEBO, and control). A 12-repetition maximum (12RM) load for the leg extension exercise was assessed through test and retest sessions before the first experimental session. The IPC session consisted of 4 cycles of 5 minutes of occlusion at 220 mm Hg of pressure alternated with 5 minutes of reperfusion at 0 mm Hg for a total of 40 minutes. The PLACEBO session consisted of 4 cycles of 5 minutes of cuff administration at 20 mm Hg of pressure alternated with 5 minutes of pseudo-reperfusion at 0 mm Hg for a total of 40 minutes. The occlusion and reperfusion phases were conducted alternately between the thighs, with subjects remaining seated. No ischemic pressure was applied during the control (CON) session and subjects sat passively for 40 minutes. Eight minutes after IPC, PLACEBO, or CON, subjects performed 3 repetition maximum sets of the leg extension (2-minute rest between sets) with the predetermined 12RM load. Four minutes after the third set for each condition, blood lactate was assessed. The results showed that for the first set, the number of repetitions significantly increased for both the IPC (13.08 +/- 2.11 p = 0.0036) and PLACEBO (13.15 +/- 0.88 p = 0.0016) conditions, but not for the CON (11.88 +/- 1.07 p > 0.99) condition. In addition, the IPC and PLACEBO conditions resulted insignificantly greater repetitions vs. the CON condition on the first set (p = 0.015 p = 0.007) and second set (p = 0.011 p = 0.019), but not on the third set (p = 0.68 p > 0.99). No difference (p = 0.465) was found in the fatigue index and lactate concentration between conditions. These results indicate that IPC and PLACEBO IPC may have small beneficial effects on repetition performance over a CON condition. Owing to potential for greater discomfort associated with the IPC condition, it is suggested that ischemic preconditioning might be practiced gradually to assess tolerance and potential enhancements to exercise performance.;0;Medi
Correlation of infrared thermography and skin perfusion in Raynaud patients and in healthy controls;LASER-DOPPLER FLOWMETRY LOCAL COLD-EXPOSURE SYSTEMIC-SCLEROSIS CAPILLARY MICROSCOPY BLOOD-FLOW MICROCIRCULATION DISORDERS DIAGNOSIS SECONDARY SCLERODERMA;"Background: We aimed to investigate the correlation of infrared thermography (IT) with laser Doppler perfusion imager (LDPI) among patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and healthy controls.

Methods: Forty-seven individuals were included: we examined 25 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and 22 age and gender matched healthy controls. IT of the volar surface of the subjects' left hands was performed to record skin temperature while skin perfusion of the same area was determined using LDPI. All measurements were obtained at room temperature (baseline measurements) and following standardized cold provocation.

Results: Good correlation of baseline measurements was found between IT and LDPI in primary Raynaud patients and healthy controls (r = 0.868, p < 0.0001 vs. r = 0.790, p < 0.0001). Following cold challenge, correlation was weaker in both groups (r = 0.742 vs. r = 0.766, p < 0.0001). Correlation after cold provocation was statistically significant among patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon in contrast to controls (Chi Quadrat, p = 0.023 vs. p = 0.306).

Conclusion: A significant correlation was found between IT and LDPI in primary Raynaud patients and in healthy controls (r = 0.868 and r = 0.742, both p < 0.0001). Following cold provocation, correlation decreases in both groups. Thus, at room temperature IT might substitute for skin perfusion measured by LDPI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Repetition of ischemic preconditioning augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation in humans - Role of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and endothelial progenitor cells;CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS VASCULAR RELAXATION LATE-PHASE EXERCISE SYNTHASE CONSEQUENCES DYSFUNCTION ACTIVATION MECHANISMS STRESS;"Background-Several studies have shown that both early and late effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protect against myocardial injury after ischemic reperfusion.

Methods and Results-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the late effects of IPC on endothelial function in humans. Late phase of IPC was induced by upper limb ischemia (cuff inflation of over 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes) 6 times a day for 1 month. We evaluated forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) before and after IPC stimulus in 30 young healthy men. FBF was measured using a strain-gauge plethysmograph. The IPC stimulus significantly increased plasma concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), circulating level of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and FBF responses to ACh, but these did not change in the control group. The FBF responses to SNP were similar before and after the IPC stimulus. Infusion of N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, completely eliminated the IPC stimulus-induced augmentation of FBF responses to ACh. In the cotralateral arms of subjects that received the IPC stimulus, FBF responses to ACh did not change, but levels of VEGF and circulating EPCs increased.

Conclusions-These findings suggest that repetition of late IPC stimulus augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation in humans through increases in nitric oxide production and number of EPCs under a local condition. Repetition of IPC stimulus may be a simple, safe, and feasible therapeutic technique for endothelial protection of peripheral vessels.";0;Medi
